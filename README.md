## Concept:
You are apart of the Bomb Squad who is trying to diffuse a very unique bomb. This bomb is not an ordinary bomb because you have to do certain puzzles to actually diffuse it. Solve all five puzzles in the given time you pass the level. Pass all 3 levels and you win!
## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* External JavaScript Library

## Approach:

#### Overview

I approached the game with end in mind, so I made most of the HTML and CSS before the JS because most the JS needs DOM elements to function properly. I then created the JS for each puzzle which took some time. Then, finally, I created the overall game logic combining the 6 separate puzzles into one game logic.

#### User stories

As the user I am presented with the start page and a play button. Once the play button is hit the main page pops up with the gameboard and side panel. Press the start button to start that level and begin completing each puzzle. once done with that level, the player will press the diffuse button to check if the level was passed. 


#### Stretch goals

* Make it to when the instructions pop up, the time stops if in-game.
* Make more trivia questions
* If you mess up on a puzzle, it decrements the timer.

## Challenges:

One challenge that was pretty tough to solve was how to make 6 games into one big game and to get those 6 games to change functionality with each level.
